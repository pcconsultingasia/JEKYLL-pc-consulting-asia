### Paul Cunliffe BEng (Hons) MBA CEng MIET - Wedding Planner, Wedding Celebrant, and Internet Marketeer

After a few years on sabbatical, I started working as the Maintenance Engineer and Tender /Operator for the Diving Decompression Chamber (&nbsp;[www.sssnetwork.com](https://sssnetwork.com/)) at Phuket International Hospital. This provided the necessary documents so I could live and work full time in Phuket. More importantly, it kept me busy and at the same time providing support to injured scuba divers in the region. I have taken a step back in recent years to concentrate on my own business, but I still do a week on diver emergency call each month.

In 2012, I met my partner Supparin and since then we have successfully built our Wedding & Event business together ([https://uniquephuket.com](https://uniquephuket.com/)). Concurrently, I formed my own company ([https://pcconsultingasia.com](https://pcconsultingasia.com/)) to enable me to work as a Wedding Planner with Supparin, Wedding Celebrant, provide website design and support as well as continue the diving chamber duties.

Unique Phuket Wedding Planners does now take up most of my time and I am relishing the challenges, but we do get to work in some of the best locations in Phuket & Phang Nga and other parts of Thailand. In conjunction, I am also a busy Wedding Celebrant ([https://weddingcelebrantasia.com](https://weddingcelebrantasia.com/)) while Supparin concentrates on her passion for flowers with Wedding Flowers Phuket ([https://weddingflowersphuket.com](https://weddingflowersphuket.com/)). It also means I work closely with many wedding and event professionals all over Phuket which has been a privilege.

I don't have much spare time now, but I do still loving traveling. I have traveled extensively throughout Thailand. My favorites places are Chumpon and Nong Kai and great memory and well worth visiting staying a few days is Doi Inthanont. Phuket has a great airport so traveling in the region is easy and another reason why I choose to live here. I guess like most people on the island the only thing I would change is the traffic\! But I guess this is the price to be paid for progress.

For the future, I do hope that Phuket becomes the premier location for business events, social events, and weddings in the region. The strong Thai Baht is not helping but that will change. I see the resorts and luxury villa companies becoming more flexible and able to adapt to the fast-changing needs of our overseas customers. This coupled with the many superb wedding & event professional I have worked with over the last few years can only help and improve the reputation of Phuket as a premier event destination.
